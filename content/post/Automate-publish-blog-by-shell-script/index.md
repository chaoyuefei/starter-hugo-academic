Here is the script. 
```shell
#!/bin/bash
git add .
git commit -m "update"
git push
hugo
cd public
git add .
git commit -m "Update something"
git push
cd ..
```
Detailed steps: 
1. Go to your website's folder and create a script file `script.sh`
2. Add the following code to the file:
```shell
#!/bin/bash
git add .
git commit -m "update"
git push
hugo
cd public
git add .
git commit -m "Update something"
git push
cd ..
```
3. Save the file and close it.
4. Make the script executable with `chmod +x script.sh`
5. Run the script with `./script.sh`
