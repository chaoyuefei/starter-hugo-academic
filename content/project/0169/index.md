A project employed Autoencoder (AE) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on the CelebA-HQ dataset.

- Successfully implemented AE model to reconstruct input images, achieving close resemblance to the original
- Employed VAE model that learned a probability distribution over the data, enabling a flexible and probabilistic approach to encoding and reconstruction
- Showcased proficiency in training and utilizing AE and VAE models, gaining practical experience in machine learning and visual computing tasks
